# Program-Structures-And-Algorithms-Project

The repository contains multi-layer perceptron code written in Java.
We have wrriten code to build a build an artificial neural network from the ground up. To write the code for a simple perceptron which can model an unlimited number of neurons and layers. To implement the blending function for the hidden and output layers. Write a driver which, given a labeled dataset, will train the model, save the model and then run the model on the test data.

PLEASE CHECK Project-Report.pdf present in the repository to see the Project Report.

STEPS TO RUN THE CODE:
1)	Download the project.
2)	Unzip the datasets (\src\com\algo\mlp\Datasets.zip).
3)	Enter the paths to the train.csv and test.csv in MultilayerPerceptron.java class.
4)	Run the file.
